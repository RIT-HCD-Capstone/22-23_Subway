Construction debris sits along the raised curb under the center set of arches.  These center arches divide  the new \"subway street\" bridge into two lanes, allowing the Interurban trains to run where Erie Canal boats once did.  A short ladder rests against the bottom of one arch, allowing workers to cross into the other lane.\n\nnegative, glass plate\noverall: 5 x 7 in.",
