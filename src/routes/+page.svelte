		<h3>IMPORTANCE</h3>
		<p>
			Graffiti played a role in the culture of the Rochester Subway, and there are several examples
			of graffiti art preserved in the Rochester Subway Archive. As an abandoned and largely
			overlooked public space, the subway tunnels became a canvas for graffiti artists who used the
			blank walls and surfaces to showcase their art.<br /><br />The graffiti in the Rochester
			Subway reflects the broader cultural trends of the time period, including the rise of hip hop
			culture, street art, and political activism. Some of the graffiti in the Archive depicts
			political slogans and social commentary, while other examples feature more stylized designs
			and lettering.<br /><br />The graffiti art in the Archive also provides a window into the
			underground culture of the subway during its heyday, as well as the subculture of graffiti
			artists and their role in the urban landscape. The Archive includes photos and videos of the
			graffiti art, as well as interviews with former subway riders and graffiti artists who reflect
			on the impact of the art and its place in the cultural history of Rochester.<br /><br
			/>Overall, the graffiti in the Rochester Subway Archive is a fascinating and valuable cultural
			artifact that offers insight into the broader trends of the time period, as well as the unique
			subculture of the Rochester Subway.
