		<h3>IMPORTANCE</h3>
		<p>
			Graffiti played a role in the culture of the Rochester Subway, and there are several examples
			of graffiti art preserved in the Rochester Subway Archive. As an abandoned and largely
			overlooked public space, the subway tunnels became a canvas for graffiti artists who used the
			blank walls and surfaces to showcase their art.
		</p>
		<p>
			The graffiti in the Rochester Subway reflects the broader cultural trends of the time period,
			including the rise of hip hop culture, street art, and political activism. Some of the
			graffiti in the Archive depicts political slogans and social commentary, while other examples
			feature more stylized designs and lettering.
		</p>
		<p>
			The graffiti art in the Archive also provides a window into the underground culture of the
			subway during its heyday, as well as the subculture of graffiti artists and their role in the
			urban landscape. The Archive includes photos and videos of the graffiti art, as well as
			interviews with former subway riders and graffiti artists who reflect on the impact of the art
			and its place in the cultural history of Rochester.
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall, the graffiti in the Rochester Subway Archive is a fascinating and valuable cultural
			artifact that offers insight into the broader trends of the time period, as well as the unique
			subculture of the Rochester Subway.
